# Predator_WebScan

Predator_WebScan is a powerful multi-purpose security tool designed to assist penetration testers and security researchers in performing advanced web fuzzing and directory scanning operations efficiently and effectively. It serves as a lightweight and flexible alternative to traditional tools like dirb, gobuster, ffuf, and wfuzz by offering dynamic fuzzing capabilities and recursive wordlist expansion.

Key Features:

üîç Web Fuzzing & Directory Scanning:

Advanced Fuzzing: Supports multiple FUZZ placeholders for flexible and dynamic input generation.

Directory Enumeration: Automatically switches to directory scanning mode if no "FUZZ" placeholder is present in the URL.

Recursive Expansion: Replaces FUZZ dynamically to generate a broad range of potential attack surfaces.

Smart Filtering: Ignores 404 responses and highlights valid results efficiently.


üöÄ High Efficiency & Flexibility:

Multiple Wordlist Support: Allows different wordlists for different placeholders (FUZZ, FUZZ1, FUZZ2, etc.).

Optimized Performance: Lightweight script designed for speed and efficiency.


Usage Examples:

üåê Web Fuzzing:

./predator_webscan.sh -u "http://example.com/FUZZ/FUZZ1" -w wordlist.txt -w1 wordlist1.txt

üìÇ Hidden Directory Scanning:

./predator_webscan.sh -u "http://example.com/" -w dirs.txt
